The Open3DScanner is an open source photogrammetry 3D Scanner. Despite its name it does not provide you with the full photogrammetry pipeline.

Instead it enables you to automaticall create sets of photos by using your smartphone camera. These photos need to be processed by your normal photogrammetry pipeline later on.

But by automating the process of capturing the required photos the time you need to spend on creating a 3D scan can significantly decreased.

## Features
- Automatic generation of photosets for photogrammetry
- Support for android and iOS devices
- Adjustable scanning parameters for different granularities of detail
- Integrated LED lights to increase illumination of photos
- Removable backplate and storage area below the baseplate for reduces space requirements
- Adjustable scanner frame for differently sized objects
- Extensive documentation, providing you with build instructions and many additional informations about photogrammetry, the design process, and other open source 3D scanners
