This is a completely redesigned version of the Nazzrims PCB.
Among other things, a connection for a reset button was added.
Furthermore, an optocoupler was used to separate the connection and a connection for an external camera was added, which Nazzrim had completely removed.
The firmware was also adapted and changed, to use the external camera pins.

You will only find the Gerber files here, I have not published any source code.
