##New revised Firmware to match the new circuit board with external camera.
Many errors have been fixed and the code has been expanded so that the function of connecting the external camera can be used.
This company product can also be compiled with the 2 Arduino IDE.
However, version 2.0.18 must be installed as ESP32 board max.
Newer drivers don't work, but I'm working on fixing that in the future.
